# Reflection at the end of watching all the videos

1. The clarity and educational value of the content?

I believe the information in Max's video were simple enough in the examples he used to explain how all these different TypeScript features behave

2. How TypeScript might influence my coding practices?

I do feel a bit more excited knowing there is a TypeScript feature to make sure my code will save me on alot of typing code which in turn makes my code more concise and easier to maintain.

3. Areas I'm confident in and those needing more exploration?

I'm confident that through trial and error i will start being more comfortable structurizing my classes, assigning types looks simple enough but it's always easy when I'm watching rather than implementing in my own code at first.
