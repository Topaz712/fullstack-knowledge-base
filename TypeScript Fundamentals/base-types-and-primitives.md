# Base Types and Primitives

## Primitives: number, string, boolean

> `let age: number;` > `age = 25;`
> or also
> `let age: number = 25;` > `age = 20;`
> both allowed

- Make sure to use number with a lowercase because we want the number primitive type

  > Using Number with uppercase N will point to the number object in JavaScript

- `let userName: string;`
  \n`userName = "Topaz";`

  > Use lowercase s for string as well

- `let isInstructor = boolean;`
  \n`isInstructor = true;`

- null and undefined are also types but we usually dont set something to be null
  > We can use null and undefined in a slightly different way --> examples in next video lesson
