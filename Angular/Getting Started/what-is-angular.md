# What is Angular?

Angular is a **JavaScript Framework** which allows us to create reactive **Single-Page-Applications**(SPAs).

- When we open the SPA, **the server sends one HTML page** with the basics of the application _then uses JavaScript to control what we see when we click around, without asking the server for new pages._

- Instead of loading new pages, the app fetches data from the server as needed in the backgroung and updates what's on the page with that data.
  > This approach makes the app faster and more responsive because it doesn't reload the entire page with each click.
