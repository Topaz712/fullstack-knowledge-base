# Angular vs Angular 2 vs Latest Version

Now a days we have many versions of Angular becuase the Angular team releases a new major version every 6 months but that doesn't mean the Framework changes, the changes are pretty minor and Angular is pretty backward compatible.

They way they are differentiated is with Angular 1 which is just called AngularJS and all the versions from Angular 2 and up are just 'Angular'

## Angular:

- Original version, also known as AngularJS.
- Released years ago, first version of Angular.
- Not future compatible because of some fundamental flaws in the way it was written.

## Angular 2:

- A complete rewrite of AngularJS.
- Released in 2016.
- Uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.
- Improved performance.

## Latest Version

- Continuation of Angular 2+.
- Still uses TypeScript.
- Continues to improve performance and maintainability.
- Regular updates and new features.
