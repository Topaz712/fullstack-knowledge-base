# Splitting Apps into Components

- In this video, Max has a web page with an two inputs and two buttons, In the First input you can put in a server name, the second input you can put server content
  - Click the button to either add server or add server blueprint for the other button
    - Below, it shows name of the server and content you input, if you click the blueprint button instead you get the test server and some content for that

At the beginning the app is just running in the app.component.html

**Splitting up the app in different components is ideal because having all the business logic in one component Won't make sense for reusability if we build a bigger app**
