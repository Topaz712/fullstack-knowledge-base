# Property and Event Binding Overview

- As we learned in the basics section of videos we know that because Angular provides tools for sending and receiving data in components, property and event binding are essential techniques for achieving this

- Property and event binding can be used not only with HTML elements and their native properties and events, but also with directives

  - This includes using property binding with directives like ngClass and ngStyle.

- Because property and event binding can also be applied to custom components, we can bind to custom properties and handle custom events within our Angular components.
  - This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive custom components in Angular applications
