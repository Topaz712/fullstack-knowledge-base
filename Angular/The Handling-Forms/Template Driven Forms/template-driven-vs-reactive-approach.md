# Template-Driven (TD) vs Reactive Approach

Angular provides two approaches for handling forms:

- _Template-driven approach_ - Angular infers the Form Object from the DOM

  - In this approach, we set up our form in the template using HTML code and Angular will automatically understand the form's structure, its controls, and help us quickly get started, so it's suitable for many use cases

- _Reactive approach_ - Form is created programmatically and synchronized with the DOM

  - The reactive approach involves defining the form's structure in TypeScript code and setting up the HTML code manually
  - It offers more control and flexibility, allowing us to fine-tune every aspect of our form but this approach is more advanced since it has a more complex approach

In this module, we'll look at two approaches that will be covered in the following videos, the simpler _template-driven approach_, suitable for many common use cases, before diving into the more advanced _reactive approach_
