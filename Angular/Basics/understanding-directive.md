# Understanding Directives

They're instrucitons in the DOM

- Components are kind of these instructions in the DOM.

When we place a selector of the component somewhere, we're instructing Angular to add the component's template content and business logic in our TypeScript code in the place we used the selector

- Components are like directives with a template and there are also directives without a template

- We can build our own custom directives and are usually applied as an attribute style
