# Reflections: Personal Insights

As of now, I'm not sure if the clarity and instructional value is sinking in as fast as I would like.. right now it feels like when you plug in many aux cables to your tv to make a game console work and all the wires are a bit tangled and the screen is a bit fuzzy from not being plugged in correctly. The game is showing on screen so it's working, why change anything right? That's how I felt coming into Angular after learning the fundamentals of JavaScript.. I'm trying to grasp all the concepts and then all of a sudden we get a new TV that has better output quality , now i need to go around and unplug the cables to set them up on the new tv and make sure everything is working as it should for smooth output, even if it means asking my dad who knows alot more than me but I hesitated to ask for help because I didn't want to admit defeat to myself or him, when in reality he'd be more than happy to help

Now that I've gotten further in the course, I have been less afraid to ask questions about things I don't know because in the end it helps me learn something I didn't know before because I know Angular will help shape the way I do future web projects, it's nice to know this framework helps make my code cleaner and more dynamic.

I'm excited to continue learning on this coding journey.
