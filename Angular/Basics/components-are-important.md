# Components are Important!

Components are a key feature in Angular.
You can build a whole application from components we create on our own.

- Basically we _write a component once_ and _use it in multiple places._
  > Components are like building blocks that we can reuse across our app.

The root component "app component" will be the component where we nest or add our other components to this template aka the html file of the app component

- With components, our code is organized and easier to maintain

  > Changes or updates to one component doesn't affect others

- Components separate our app's logic from its presentation

  > This separation makes our code cleaner and easier to maintain

- Each component will have its own styles, templates, and logic
  > Styles and logic in one component doesn't interfere with others

**In the end, Components make our code more readable and understandable and it's clear what each part of our app does.**
