# String Interpolation

Any expression that can be resolved to a string in the end, is the only condition for string interpolation syntax

- Whatever we have between the double curly braces `{{ something }}` has to return a string and we can also call a method here `{{ something() }}`which returns a string in the end.

  > numbers can also be stored because they can be converted into a string, so a string or anythign that can be converted into a string

- Cannot write multi-line expression in there, cant write block expressions which means no if or for control structure
