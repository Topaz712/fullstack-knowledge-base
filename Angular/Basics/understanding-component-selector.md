# Fully Understanding the Component Selector

In CSS we can select elements by attribute, enclosing that attribute in squared brackets.`'[app-servers]'`

- Selectors work like CSS selectors and not limited to selecting by elements

- We can make the selector contain an attribute or a class `<div class="app-servers"></div>`
  becuase its recognized by Angular as a selector

- ID and pseudo-selectors "like `hover:` and etc" wont work for referencing components because its not supported by Angular
