# Where to learn more about Pipes

For more information on built-in pipes and how to customize them, we have to check out the official Angular documentation at [https://angular.io/api/common#pipes](https://angular.io/api/common#pipes)

In the API reference section, we search for `pipe` to find a list of built in pipes

We can explore different pipes and learn how to configure them to best fit our specific needs

The documentation offers detailed explanations and examples to help us understand and use pipes effectively in our Angular applications
