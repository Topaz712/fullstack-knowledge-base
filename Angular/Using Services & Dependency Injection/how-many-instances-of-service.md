# How many Instances of Service Should It Be?

In some applications, we might need multiple instances of the same service, while in other cases, we want just one shared instance

- The decision depends on the specific use case and the behavior we want to achieve

In apps, sometimes we need many service copies, other times only one shared instance

- For shared data and features, we should pick one shared instance
- For separate, unique tasks, we should go for multiple instances

In the end it depends on our case and goals for using it
