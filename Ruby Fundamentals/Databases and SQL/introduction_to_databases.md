- We use databases to store data in a structured way on computer systems, making it easy to manage and access 

- They are crucial in various applications, especially for large multiuser setups where coordination is essential 

- Even individual users benefit from databases, like in electronic mail programs and personal organizers

# Databse Management Systems

- A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that organizes and stores data using standardized methods 

- With DBMS, tt allows data manipulation, since we can add, update, delete, or navigate/traverse data using standardized algorithms and queries

- We categorize DBMS based on data structures or types, it adapts smoothly to changes in our information systems as our organization's needs evolve
  - Adding new data categories doesn't disrupt the existing system

- This is crucial for effective data management and analysis 
  - For instance, creating a sales report for a salesteam detailing customers contacted and total sales in the last month would be challenging without a DBMS due to scattered data but a DBMS simplifies generating this with a few queries

  - SQLite
