# Collaborative Discussion: Ruby fundamentals

1. What are the major differences and similarities do Ruby and JavaScript have?

- A similarity would be how in a Ruby class we use initialize which is the equivalent to Javascript's constructor model and so in Ruby's we initialize instance variables in it

- I would say that some loops seem to be similar to how they are Javascript as well

- I guess with Javascript, everything is an object and then with Rails, everything is a class

- A big difference I did notice was just how classes and methods are set up and the way class/instance variables are used

2. In what areas would you consider that you need practice on when it comes to Ruby Fundamentals or programming fundamentals in general (data types, variables, control flows, loops, methods, ect).

- I know that remembering data types will be a bit challenging at first but something I hope to know well by the end without looking it up is difference between variables for classes in Ruby
  - For class variables in Ruby, the double `@@` operator is used
  - Then for an instance of a class only a single `@` operator is used
    - The values of instance variables are only specific to the instance they were created in 

- I know i will also need to practice methods to really grasp the foundation of the basics since I can feel a bit of pushback on my part and am not too confident yet when I come across a practice problem on my own
